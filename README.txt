This is my group's submission for the Yelp Dataset Challenge


I focused in on text mining the user reviews to build a classifier that could predict positive reviews based on what the user wrote.

My coding and analysis can be found in SECTION TWO of the .rmd file, and from slides 48-56 in the powerpoint.
